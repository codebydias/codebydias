### 🎯 Career Goal

I am currently working as a fullstack intern focusing on Laravel, but my mid-term goal is to become a backend development specialist.
I am very interested in participating in highly scalable projects, with clean code, well-defined architecture and a focus on elegance, performance and clarity of understanding — principles that I believe are essential for quality software.
